I am a student majoring in Information Security and Computer Science, highly motivated by technology and committed to developing hands-on experience with modern cybersecurity tools and techniques.

## Objective
My experience in Army computer networking and IT has driven a strong interest in cybersecurity. I am seeking to transition into a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst, where I can apply my technical foundation, security training, and disciplined problem-solving skills to monitor, detect, and respond to security threats.
